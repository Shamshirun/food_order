                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Traffic rule enforcement is becoming a widespread these days and the need to manage this unorganised system is necessary.  Our system enables the traffic policemen to manage  traffic violations such as overspeeding, signal jumping,  helmetless driving, etc.,  recorded at various parts of given metropolitan area and data associated with them from a central database. As soon as the vehicle number is fed to the system it displays all the information related to the violator, his vehicle and his violations. After which a receipt will be generated for his unpaid violations. This system also focuses on reduction of corruption in traffic administration, as the billing and updation of violations work in conjunction.</p>
